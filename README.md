# Command-line-subtitle-reader
A little program I made to print out subtitles from an SRT file line by line in real time on the command line.

Usage:
make file executable (chmod +x srtwait)
./srtwait Filename
Will output file line by line onto the command line. 
I might add a command-line option to clear everything before printing a new line.
